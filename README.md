# Mockups to Code

## Part 1 Setup & HTML

A big and normal struggle is to take a mockup and turn it into a website.

This site is inspired by: Hullo https://hullopillow.com

[This is a companion video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGpw0wGgvgc&list=PLmRos5Kcpwc_ENY6d8Nc7M4Dnr-DH5Bq_) that shows an approach to create this. 

## Prerequisits

- HTML fundamentals
- CSS fundamentals (box model, selectors)
- CSS flexbox basics

If you want to try it yourself you will also need:

- Terminal/command line basics
- Text editor basics
- Git/GitHub basics

## Getting started

If you want to code along, you can

- fork and clone this repository
- navigate to the folder and type `open index.html` to open the file in the browser

## Start with the Mockup

## Determine our Components and the Elements they are Made Up of

## Start Coding

- `cd build`
- open `index.html` and `main.css` in your text editor
- open `index.html` in the browser, check that background color is set.

###### Important to Note

The website will be going through an awkward phase. It won't look good with just HTML, but as long as there is good structure and a plan it will come together!

### Google fonts

On the first line of `main.css`:

```CSS
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400&family=Raleway:wght@400;700&display=swap");
```
